            After attending an all boys boarding school in Connecticut, I spent my late teens and early twenties attending West Point for a short period, serving in the Marine Corps, and honing my craft as a strength and conditioning coach. In 2019, after my military service came to an end, I started Delta Five Performance, a strength and conditioning service built to serve elite athletes on their journey to success.  After a few years, I eventually opened a state of the art training facility in Avon, CO called MTN Barbell with two other business partners.

                MTN Barbell is a uniquely special facility located in Avon, Colorado, 
                just west of the more famous Vail. Stacked with some of the best equipment
                in the world, there are very few lines of tissue, if any at all, that 
                you couldn't train with an optimal stimulus inside our walls.  Our low volume
                membership model allows for MTN Barbell to exist as a private training facility
                for anyone lucky enough to have a spot.  Combined with the best training staff in
                the Vail Valley, you would be hard pressed to find a better option to turn your dreams
                into reality.
