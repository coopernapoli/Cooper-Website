        <p> 
            After attending an all boys boarding school in Connecticut, I spent my late teens and early twenties attending West Point for a short period, serving in the Marine Corps, and honing my craft as a strength and conditioning coach. In 2019, after my military service came to an end, I started Delta Five Performance, a strength and conditioning service built to serve elite athletes on their journey to success.  After a few years, I eventually opened a state of the art training facility in Vail, CO called MTN Barbell with two other business partners.
